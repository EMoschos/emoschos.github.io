# REACT PORTFOLIO
My Bio has been updated to utilise React.js

My Bio/Portfolio is based on a business idea that I had discussed with some friends so I thought I would keep that theme. 

# Objectives
Following the Homework readme directions I have updated the Bio to use React.js.  Used header, footer, project components along with React-Router to complete this project.  There is a link to GitHub and LinkedIn at the bottom of the web page with both of these account being updated with info.

# List of Working links
All relevant links for testing.  Bio contains links to project web apps
